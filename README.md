# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin-Cancer (Malignant vs. Benign) Detection using Deep-CNN and Hyperparameter tuning using keras-tuner

### Overview
In this work, we address the problem of skin cancer classification using convolutional neural networks. A lot of cancer cases early on are misdiagnosed leading to severe consequences including the death of patient. Also there are cases in which patients have other problems and doctors interpret it as skin cancer. This leads to unnecessary time and money spent for further diagnosis. In this work, we address the above problems using deep cnn neural networks.

### Dataset
This dataset contains a balanced dataset of images of benign skin moles and malignant skin moles.The data consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of the two types of moles.
